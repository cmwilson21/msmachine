# About

This project was created with React as brochure type landing/display page for a machine and fabrication shop. It was styled using both Material-UI and CSS styling.

I also connected an embedded map via Google Maps API so visitors can easiy find directions. It was my first time working with Google Maps API, so was a great learning experience!

I hosted it using Heroku, so check it out [here](https://msmachine.herokuapp.com/).
